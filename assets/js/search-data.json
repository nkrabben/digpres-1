    "content": "The program’s short definition is that “Digital preservation ensures reliable long-term access to digital objects”. We understand each component of that definition as follows: . | ensures - we prefer to document, monitor, and audit rather than to perform heroic interventions | reliable - we maintain processes that can adapt to changing technology, staff turnover, and new types of collections, so that other parts of the library can focus on their roles | long-term access - we think about how our work can support access today and 25 years in the future | digital objects - we work with any collection material that can be stored digitally, whether digitized or born-digital, original or derived | . There’s no one true way to do digital preservation. We constantly compare our own policies and processes to others’ in hope of refining and improving them. ",
